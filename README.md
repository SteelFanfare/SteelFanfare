## How to play

You must gather as many people as possible for your future concert. Your robots will bring flyers to your fans, but for this they will have to play the right radio station to attract them.

Be careful as the street is full of hazards. Cars are driving on both sides of the road and can be dangerous for both fans and your robots, and repelling them with the wrong music will prove fatal. If too many people are run over by cars, you will lose one of your robots.

As your robots are not waterproof, they will break down upon walking in puddles.

Find broken housewares to rebuild one of your lost robots.

In the end you will see your score and the total casualties caused by your marketing operation.
